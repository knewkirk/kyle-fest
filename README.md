# KYLE FEST
**[kyle-fe.st](kyle-fe.st)**

_The hottest party of April 2023._

A marketing-style site for my birthday party, because why not. Best experienced on mobile.

The first version lives at the `/old` route, and uses [parallax.js](https://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) for mobile gyro effects.

The current version (reachable at the root) uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/) heavily for 3d effects.

## Installation
`> yarn`

And copy `.env.example` to `.env` and get the firebase API key from Kyle.

## Development
**To build:**


`> npm run build`

_OR_

`> npm run watch`

**To serve locally:**

`> npm run serve`
